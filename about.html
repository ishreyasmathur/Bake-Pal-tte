  <h2 >Founder - Mrinali Mathur</h2>
  <p style="color: rgb(234, 0, 255); font-size: 16px;">
    Hi guys! Many new people here, I thought I’d give my little intro- I'm Mrinali Mathur. I'm 23 years old and I live in Jaipur, Rajasthan.

    I'm so happy that you're here. Grab a cookie, take a seat and let me introduce myself. I am a baker and an engineer( also a well-known lover of Brownies ) From a very young age, I watched my mother work her baking magic along with several other things and when I was in class 8th I baked my first Christmas cake, I was hooked! Then, I started attending baking workshops regularly in 2017, enjoyed the entire process very much and eventually found my calling . Baking has always been a welcome creative release for me and Bake Palètte is an outcome of that.
    I started Bake Palètte in 2019 as a personal blog to share my baked goods with friends and family. At that time I wasn't sure that it will grow into something which is an important part of me. Bake Palètte is a bakery where you will find a dessert for every occasion which is prepared with utmost cleanliness in the best possible sanitised way and obviously with best quality ingredients available.
